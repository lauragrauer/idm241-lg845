   <h1 class="rules-title">OVERVIEW</h1>
 <!-- ===================== OVERVIEW ===================== -->
   <section>
    <img src="final-image.jpg" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">

     <br>Although very straight to the point when finally clicked on by the user, the 
     original dog slideshow on Petfinder lacked warmth, clarity, and intuitive interaction, 
     making it difficult to fully understand both the breed and the intended micro interaction 
     experience. With no clear navigation cues, minimal motion feedback, and inconsistent animation 
     states among slides, users had little guidance or motivation to explore. 
     <br><br>During the 
     redesign period, the site updated its slideshow; but the new layout became visually 
     fragmented with elements misaligned, irregular spacing, and content occasionally cut 
     off, further emphasizing the need for a more structured interaction model.
     <br><br>
     Over a ten week time frame, I redesigned an HTML-based prototype that focused on 
     creating a friendlier, more dog-centered interaction. By introducing softer 
     transitions, paw-shaped navigation controls, restructuring the slideshow layout, 
     and adding playful animations across the five interactive models, the updated 
     experience improves affordance and creates a warmer, more emotional tone that better
    aligns with the content being presented. 
    
    <br><br>These changes transform the slideshow from
    a static image viewer into a more exploratory and engaging moment within the site,
    encouraging users to meaningfully interact with the breed visuals rather than 
    simply scrolling past them.

   <h1 class="rules-title">CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES</h1>
 <!-- ===================== CONTEXT AND CHALLANGES ===================== -->
   <section>
    <img src="original-objects.gif" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">
    <span class="object-title">BACKGROUND</span>
    <span class="bold">Information on Petfinder</span>
    <br><br>Petfinder's specific dog breed page serves as a quick informational entry 
     point for users researching a particular breed with a possible adoption 
     consideration taken into account. The original slideshow provided visual 
     reference, but did so with unclear navigation and inconsistent motion cues; 
     this can result in a disengaging experience. Over the course of 10 weeks, the 
     purpose of this redesign was to evaluate and enhance the micro interaction 
     within the slideshow section so users would feel encouraged to browse, interact,
      and understand the image and the concept of the breed. 
    <hr class="divider">

    <span class="object-title">THE PROBLEM</span>
    <span class="bold">Lack of Affordance, Interesting Animations, Consistency</span>
    <br><br>While the slideshow technically displays imagery, the thumbnail area lacks
     clear affordance, giving users little indication that the gallery can be 
     interacted with beyond the cursor changing to a pointer. Interaction states 
     are also inconsistent. Certain elements trigger animations while others remain
      static. Clicking on the main image or the close (X) button results in no 
      transitional feedback, yet clicking on the arrows or thumbnails triggers a 
      slide animation. This uneven behavior may create abrupt transitions that 
      interrupt the expected continuity of the interaction, making the slideshow 
      feel partially unfinished rather than intentional. The primary goal of this 
      project is to transform an underdeveloped interaction into a more polished 
      experience that better aligns with the emotional tone of viewing and learning 
      about a dog breed. 
    <hr class="divider">
  
    <span class="object-title">GOALS & OBJECTIVES</span>
    <span class="bold">Improved Animations...Encouragment to continue</span>
    <br><br>Key indicators defined by measurable improvements would be the increased
     animation across the images and reduced single image exits; overall though, 
     a more consistent user progression with proper formatting would encourage 
     continued browsing rather than stopping after the initial view. Ensuring that
      each interaction state responds in a predictable manner would also reinforce
       the indented experience. These enhancements would not only improve usability
        but also support a stronger emotional connection with the content.
    <hr class="divider"></section>

  <h1 class="rules-title">PROCESS AND INSIGHTS</h1>
 <!-- ===================== PROCESS AND INSIGHTS ===================== -->
   <section>
    <br><br>To redesign the slideshow in a way that felt intentional, intuitive, 
    and emotionally aligned with Petfinder’s user experience, I broke the project 
    into several research driven steps. This process allowed me to move beyond 
    simply “fixing animations” and instead understand the deeper interactions, 
    motivations, and behaviors driving the user experience. 
    
    <hr class="divider">
      <img src="user-persona.jpg" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">
    <span class="object-title">USER PERSONA</span>
    <span class="bold">Trish Martin, Casual and Practical</span>
    <br><br>Because Petfinder attracts a wide range of users, from casual scrollers
    to potential adopters, I created a primary user persona, Trish Martin, to anchor 
    all design decisions. Trish’s calm, practical browsing habits highlighted the 
    need for an interface that felt intuitive, gentle, and emotionally warm rather 
    than abrupt or technical. Her frustrations with unclear navigation and inconsistent
     visual feedback directly informed the redesign direction.

    <span class="object-title">UX FLOW</span>
    <span class="bold">5 Objects Understanding</span>
    <br><br>I mapped a simple user journey that followed Trish’s behavior:
    Browse → Notice image → Hover/Click → Enter Lightbox → Navigate thumbnails → 
    Exit → Share <br>A better understanding of the journey map was essential for me 
    to break down the slideshow into individual steps to analyze as separate objects. 
    Instead of looking at the overall section as a big, vague experience, a journey 
    map would let me see exactly where things could stay as is or needed improvement.

      <img src="color-sheet.jpg" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">
    <span class="object-title">STYLE SHEET</span>
    <span class="bold">Original Colors, Slight Rebranding</span>
    <br><br>Using the original Petfinder color palette is vital because it preserves
    brand recognition and visual continuity across the entire experience. Since users
    already associate Petfinder’s signature colors with pet related browsing, 
    maintaining that palette ensures the redesigned slideshow feels native to 
    the platform rather than an external addition. I expanded on this by 
    incorporating more of the original colors directly into the micro interactions
    and the objects themselves. Subtle shifts to lighter and darker variations of
    Petfinder’s core hues were used to indicate hover, active, and click states, 
    creating clearer behavioral feedback while still remaining true to the brand. 
    This approach strengthens both usability and emotional consistency, helping users
    feel grounded in the familiar Petfinder environment.

  <h1 class="rules-title">THE SOLUTION</h1>
 <!-- ===================== THE SOLUTION ===================== -->
   <section>
    <br><br>Again, a need for a consistent use of animations were needed to
     create clearer feedback and a more intuitive browsing experience.
    
    <hr class="divider">
      <img src="object-1.gif" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">
    <span class="object-title">OBJECT 1 - MAIN LARGE IMAGE</span>
    <span class="bold">Changes</span>
    <br><br>
    <li>Reconstructed the layout of the thumbnails and main image by resizing the main for more primary focus </li>
    <li>Added hover states that slightly scale and brighten the image</li>
    <li>Added a click interaction that expands the image into the lightbox and animates upward</li>
    <br>
   <span class="bold">Why</span><br><br>
  Previously, the interaction relied solely on a cursor change to communicate clickability, which offered minimal visual feedback and could easily be overlooked. The large image is the primary focus of the user. By providing a scaling and brightness visual change cue alongside the change of the cursor to the pointer during the hover state, it communicates to the user that the image is clickable. When clicked, the upward movement and fade transition reinforces that the user is shifting into a focused viewing state in a playful pet centric manner.


    <hr class="divider">
      <img src="object-2.gif" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">
    <span class="object-title">OBJECT 2 - LIGHT BOX ARROWS</span>
    <span class="bold">Changes</span>
    <br><br>
    <li>Positioned paw shaped arrows with more of a gap between them and the focused image</li>
    <li>Added hover animation with increased brightness</li>
    <li>Implemented fade and bounce/rotation effects when clicked</li>
    <br>
   <span class="bold">Why</span><br><br>
  Previously, a simple slide animation displayed when the arrow was clicked. With the improvements, the simple arrows were now paw shaped with an animated bounce effect when clicked to consistently provide a pet focused theme. The arrow movement reinforces a cause and effect relationship to help users understand that the view will shift in response to their action.
    
    <hr class="divider">
      <img src="object-3.gif" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">
    <span class="object-title">OBJECT 3 - X/CLOSE BUTTON</span>
    <span class="bold">Changes</span>
    <br><br>
    <li>Designed opacity changes on hover</li>
    <li>Added movement and rotation on click</li>
    <br>
   <span class="bold">Why</span><br><br>
  Closing the gallery previously felt abrupt, with no visual cue other than the cursor to pointer change. By animating the X, fading the gallery, and returning to the main view with a progressive shift, the exit action feels intentional rather than harsh. Users retain context because the lightbox fades back into the original image rather than resetting entirely.


    
    <hr class="divider">
      <img src="object-4.gif" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">
    <span class="object-title">OBJECT 4 - SLIDER NAVIGATION ARROWS</span>
    <span class="bold">Changes</span>
    <br><br>
    <li>Implemented slider arrows visible above/below thumbnails on desktop and sideways on mobile</li>
    <li>Added scaling and color inversion on hover</li>
    <li>Linked every click to the active image state</li>
    <br>
   <span class="bold">Why</span><br><br>
  The original site lacked explicit navigation controls, offering no clear way to move through the slideshow beyond a hover cursor change. The updated design implements slider navigation arrows that provide a more clear spatial direction from image to image. These controls not only increase comprehension of the thumbnail area, but also gives users a direct agency in choosing where to go next rather than relying on guessing.

    
    <hr class="divider">
      <img src="object-5.gif" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">
    <span class="object-title">OBJECT 5 - THUMBNAIL SLIDER IMAGES</span>
    <span class="bold">Changes</span>
    <br><br>
    <li>Added hover scaling</li>
    <li>Highlighted active selection with a colored border</li>
    <li>Synced their state to the main image fade</li>
    <br>
   <span class="bold">Why</span><br><br>
  Thumbnails serve as previews, so interaction must visually confirm selection. The purple border and fade transition ensure that users always understand which image is currently active. The hover scaling adds a tactile quality that matches the rest of the object animations in an engaging and intentionally consistent manner.
    <hr class="divider">
  <span class="bold">Across all five objects, the intention was to create a continuous, motion based interaction system. This is to be driven by a more emotionally oriented user experience that aligns with the playful, pet centered nature of the content.

   <h1 class="rules-title">THE RESULTS</h1>
 <!-- ===================== THE RESULTS ===================== -->
   <section>
    <img src="full-objects.gif" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">
    <br>The redesigned slideshow addresses the primary goals of improving affordance, emotional tone, and interaction consistency. By implementing clear navigation cues, predictable animation states, and a more visually engaging structure, the prototype demonstrated measurable improvements in user progression through the gallery. Through this process, I learned the importance of breaking an interaction into smaller components before attempting to solve the larger visual behavior. Mapping the user journey and assigning personality to the persona provided clearer direction for the micro interactions, and analyzing each object individually made it easier to maintain consistency across the entire system. In the near future, I plan to expand on this by refining animation/transition timing to correlate with the user's experience.
