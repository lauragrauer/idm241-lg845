   <h1 class="rules-title">OVERVIEW</h1>
 <!-- ===================== OVERVIEW ===================== -->
   <section>
    <img src="final-image.jpg" alt="Final redesigned slideshow interface" class="final-image">

     <br>Although very straight to the point when finally clicked on by the user, the 
     original dog slideshow on Petfinder lacked warmth, clarity, and intuitive interaction, 
     making it difficult to fully understand both the breed and the intended micro interaction 
     experience. With no clear navigation cues, minimal motion feedback, and inconsistent animation 
     states among slides, users had little guidance or motivation to explore. 
     <br><br>During the 
     redesign period, the site updated its slideshow; but the new layout became visually 
     fragmented with elements misaligned, irregular spacing, and content occasionally cut 
     off, further emphasizing the need for a more structured interaction model.
     <br><br>
     Over a ten week time frame, I redesigned an HTML-based prototype that focused on 
     creating a friendlier, more dog-centered interaction. By introducing softer 
     transitions, paw-shaped navigation controls, restructuring the slideshow layout, 
     and adding playful animations across the five interactive models, the updated 
     experience improves affordance and creates a warmer, more emotional tone that better
    aligns with the content being presented. 
    
    <br><br>These changes transform the slideshow from
    a static image viewer into a more exploratory and engaging moment within the site,
    encouraging users to meaningfully interact with the breed visuals rather than 
    simply scrolling past them.
